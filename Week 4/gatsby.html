<h1>The Great Gatsby Mad Libs</h1>

			<p>I was <span id="adj1">alone</span> and it was almost <span id = "number">two</span>. For some <span id = "noun">time</span> <span id="adj2">confused</span> and intriguing sounds had issued from a <span id="adj3">long</span>, <span id="adj4">many-windowed</span> room which overhung the terrace. Eluding <span id="n">Jordan</span>’s undergraduate, who was now engaged in a <span id="adj5">obstetrical</span> conversation with two <span id="adj6">chorus</span> girls, and who <span id="verb1">implored</span> me to join him, I went inside.</p>

	<p>The <span id="adj7">large</span> room was full of <span id="noun1">people</span>. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous <span id="noun2">chorus</span>, engaged in song. She had <span id="verb2">drunk</span> a quantity of <span id="noun3">champagne</span>, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very <span id = "adj8">sad</span> — she was not only <span id = "verb3">singing</span>, she was <span id = "verb4">weeping</span> too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with <span id = "adj9">gasping</span>, <span id = "adj10">broken</span> sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano.</p>
